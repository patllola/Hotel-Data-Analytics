## 1. Introduction
Hotel Data Analytics is a project aimed at analyzing hotel-related data to gain insights and make data-driven decisions. The three main components of this project are Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, and Data Transformation. Each step plays a crucial role in preparing the data for further analysis and visualization.

## 2. Requirements
To run the scripts in this repository, you need the following software and libraries installed on your system:

Python (>= 3.6)
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebooks)

## 3. Installation
To install the required Python libraries, you can use pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
Alternatively, you can set up a virtual environment to manage the dependencies.

## 4. Data Exploration
In the 'data_exploration' directory, you will find scripts and Jupyter notebooks that help you explore the hotel data. Data Exploration involves understanding the structure of the dataset, examining summary statistics, identifying missing values, and visualizing key trends.

## 5. Data Cleaning
The 'data_cleaning' directory contains scripts and notebooks for Data Cleaning. Data Cleaning is essential for dealing with missing or inconsistent data, removing duplicates, and handling outliers. This step ensures the data is in a clean and usable format for further analysis.

## 6. Data Transformation
The 'data_transformation' directory includes scripts and notebooks to perform Data Transformation. This step involves aggregating data, creating new features, and preparing the dataset for various analysis tasks, such as clustering or predictive modeling.

## 7. Usage
To use this repository, follow these steps:

## Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.
Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the Requirements section.
Explore the 'data_exploration,' 'data_cleaning,' and 'data_transformation' directories for relevant scripts and notebooks.
Execute the scripts/notebooks in the correct order to perform Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, and Data Transformation for your hotel data.
